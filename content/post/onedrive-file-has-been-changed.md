When saving files to a OneDrive folder in macOS, you may receive an error similar to:

> "~/Somefile" could not be saved. The file has been changed by another application.

This issue can be resolved by turning off the **Files On-Demand** feature in **OneDrive > Preferences**. Note that doing so causes a copy of all files to be stored on your local hard drive, and you will lose any [benefits associated with on-demand file management](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-disk-space-with-onedrive-files-on-demand-for-mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).
